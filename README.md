# Projects MASTER
Projects developed throughout 2022-2023 during senior year at Mayo High School under Mr. Eric Dirks. The goal of this independent study course was to understand Linear Algebra, bayesian analysis, inference, and machine learning. This course was co-taught alongside the MIT OCW "Linear Algbera in Statistics". 

##GPT-3.5 Detection:
We hypothesize that traditional AI-detection algorithms may not effectively flag advanced language models. Utilizing the RoBERTa algorithm, random forest machine learning, and Bayesian analysis, we reverse engineer an AI-detection method that translates flagged GPT-4 responses into valid ones via reinforcement-based learning.

##Bluetooth Webbing:
We hypothesize that a dedicated Bluetooth network can facilitate text and call transmissions independently of Wi-Fi or cellular signals. Performed trials in a three-dimensional 1500 ft space using three separate devices to validate the concept.

##Movement Interpretation:
We hypothesize that mouth movements in visual media can be interpreted into subtitles using machine learning. Developed an auto-regressive machine learning model with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in PyTorch, trained on movies and YouTube footage, to test this assumption. This was a joint project between Prof. Dirks and the Linear Algebra in Statistics course at Mayo High School. 

##Ethereum 2.0 Optimizer:
We hypothesize that on-chain analytics can reveal optimization opportunities in the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. Conducted studies on potential optimization and made observations accordingly.

##Radio Modeling:
We hypothesize that radio signal behaviors can be predicted through AI and reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms. Created a 4-D weighted map considering time, day, weather, and location to assess this.

##GPT-Comparable Model:
We hypothesize that a PyTorch-based generative language model can achieve performance levels similar to OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2. Modified versions of publicly available weights and self-trained data were used to validate this hypothesis.
